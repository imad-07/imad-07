# 👋 Hey, I’m **Imad Tounsadi**
### Developer • Problem Solver • Systems Thinker

I build things that **work fast**, **scale clean**, and **teach me something new every time**.  
From backend systems to small game engines, from AI tools to custom frameworks — I love diving deep into how things *really* work.

## 🚀 About Me

I’m a developer who enjoys understanding systems from the ground up —  
how a **router resolves a request**, how a **compiler transforms code**, how an **AI model reasons**, or how **memory flows inside Go and Rust**.

I like building things that most people think are “too complex” for fun:
- A **wget clone** I wrote from scratch  
- A **mini JavaScript framework** with its own VDOM, router & state manager  
- A **WebSocket chat system** in Next.js  
- A **YouTube + MedLlama medical tool**  
- A **Pacman AI** where I recreated ghost behavior  
- A **traffic intersection simulation in Rust**  
- Real-time **screen sharing + collaborative editing**

I learn, I break things, I rebuild them better.

## 🧭 What Drives Me

I like problems that require thinking —  
not just coding.

I enjoy:
- Understanding systems deeply  
- Learning by building  
- Simplifying complexity  
- Teaching others what I learn  
- Documenting journeys  

Each project is a **new horizon**,  
and each horizon is a **new beginning**.
